### Detailed Example Answer for Kubernetes Networking

**Kubernetes Networking - Life of a Network Packet**

1. **Container to Outside World:**
   - When a container inside a Pod initiates communication with the outside world, the packet first hits the virtual Ethernet interface (veth) assigned to the container.
   
2. **Container NIC:**
   - The packet moves from the container's virtual Ethernet interface to the root network namespace through a veth pair. Each Pod is assigned an IP address from the Pod network, and each container within the Pod shares the same network namespace, thus the same IP address.
   
3. **Node NIC:**
   - The packet is then forwarded to the node's network interface card (NIC). If the destination is outside the Kubernetes cluster, it traverses through the node's default gateway to reach the external network.
   
4. **Kube-Proxy:**
   - Kube-Proxy is responsible for service discovery and load balancing. It updates iptables rules to direct traffic destined for Kubernetes services to the appropriate backend Pods. If the packet is targeting a Kubernetes service, kube-proxy will handle the redirection to the correct Pod IP.
   
5. **IPTables:**
   - IPTables rules are applied for packet filtering and NAT. These rules manage the routing of packets between the different network namespaces, services, and Pods within the cluster. It ensures that the packet reaches its correct destination within the cluster or gets NAT-ed for external communication.

6. **Diagram:**
   - Here's a simplified visual representation of the packet journey:

```
 +-------------+                   +-------------+                    +-------------+
 |  Container  |  <----veth---->   |   Pod's     |  <----veth---->    |   Node's    |
 |   (NIC)     |                   |  Network    |                   |  Network    |
 |             |                   |  Namespace  |                   |  Namespace  |
 +-------------+                   +-------------+                    +-------------+
                                                                  |
                                                                  v
 +-------------+                   +-------------+                    +-------------+
 |  Kube-Proxy |  <----iptables--> |  Node's     |  <----nic---->     |  External   |
 |             |                   |  Network    |                   |  Network    |
 |             |                   | Interface   |                   |             |
 +-------------+                   +-------------+                    +-------------+
```

**Kube-DNS:**

**Role and Importance:**
- Kube-DNS is a DNS server that serves DNS records for Kubernetes services. It translates service names into IP addresses, allowing Pods to communicate with services using a consistent naming convention.

**Example:**
- If you have a service named `my-service` in the `default` namespace, Kube-DNS ensures that `my-service.default.svc.cluster.local` resolves to the service's cluster IP address. This enables any Pod within the cluster to access `my-service` using this DNS name, facilitating easier and more maintainable network communication.

These questions and answers should help you prepare for a comprehensive DevOps interview, covering a range of tools and real-world scenarios.
